      <h2><a name="Introduction">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

      <p>
        This chapter talks about how BASIC stores and manipulates data. The
        topics include:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          A brief mention of the operating system components and functions as
          well as the character set used in the Commodore 64.
        </li>

        <li>
          The formation of constants and variables. What types of variables
          there are. And how constants and variables are stored in memory.
        </li>

        <li>
          The rules for arithmetic calculations, relationship tests, string
          handling, and logical operations. Also included are the rules for
          forming expressions, and the data conversions necessary when you're
          using BASIC with mixed data types.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2><a name="Screen">SCREEN DISPLAY CODES (BASIC CHARACTER SET)</a></h2>

      <h3><a name="Operating">THE OPERATING SYSTEM (OS)</a></h3>

      <p>
        The Operating System is contained in the Read Only Memory (ROM) chips
        and is a combination of three separate, but interrelated, program
        modules.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>The BASIC Interpreter</li>
        <li>The KERNAL</li>
        <li>The Screen Editor</li>
      </ol>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>The BASIC Interpreter</b> is responsible for analyzing BASIC
          statement syntax and for performing the required calculations and/or
          data manipulation. The BASIC Interpreter has a vocabulary of 65
          "keywords" which have special meanings. The upper and lower case
          alphabet and the digits 0-9 are used to make both keywords and
          variable names. Certain punctuation characters and special symbols
          also have meanings for the Interpreter. Table 1-1 lists the special
          characters and their uses.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>The KERNAL</b> handles most of the interrupt level processing in
          the system (for details on interrupt level processing, see Chapter 5).
          The KERNAL also does the actual input and output of data.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>The Screen Editor</b> controls the output to the video screen
          (television set) and the editing of BASIC program text. In addition,
          the Screen Editor intercepts keyboard input so that it can decide
          whether the characters put in should be acted upon immediately, or
          passed on to the BASIC Interpreter.
        </li>

      <p>The Operating System gives you two modes of BASIC operation:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>DIRECT Mode</li>
        <li>PROGRAM Mode</li>
      </ol>

      <ol>
        <li>
          When you're using the DIRECT mode, BASIC statements don't have line
          numbers in front of the statement. They are executed whenever the
          <kbd>&lt;RETURN&gt;</kbd> key is pressed.
        </li>
        <li>The PROGRAM mode is the one you use for running programs.</li>
      </ol>

      <ol start="2">
        <li>
          When using the PROGRAM mode, all of your BASIC statements must have
          line numbers in front of them. You can have more than one BASIC
          statement in a line of your program, but the number of statements is
          limited by the fact that you can only put 80 characters on a logical
          screen line. This means that if you are going to go over the 80
          character limit you have to put the entire BASIC statement that
          doesn't fit on a new line with a new line number.

      <p>
        The Commodore 64 has two complete character sets that you can use either
        from the keyboard or in your programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        In SET 1, the upper case alphabet and the numbers 0-9 are available
        without pressing the <kbd>&lt;SHIFT&gt;</kbd> key. If you hold down the
        <kbd>&lt;SHIFT&gt;</kbd> key while typing, the graphics characters on
        the RIGHT side of the front of the keys are used. If you hold down the
        <kbd>&lt;C=&gt;</kbd> key while typing, the graphics characters on the
        LEFT side of the front of the key are used. Holding down the
        <kbd>&lt;SHIFT&gt;</kbd> key while typing any character that doesn't
        have graphic symbols on the front of the key gives you the symbol on the
        top most part of the key.
      </p>
      <p>
        In SET 2, the lower case alphabet and the numbers 0-9 are available
        without pressing the <kbd>&lt;SHIFT&gt;</kbd> key. The upper case
        alphabet is available when you hold down the
        <kbd>&lt;SHIFT&gt;</kbd> key while typing. Again, the graphic symbols on
        the LEFT side of the front of the keys are displayed by pressing the
        <kbd>&lt;C=&gt;</kbd> key, while the symbols on the top most part of any
        key without graphics characters are selected when you hold down the
        <kbd>&lt;SHIFT&gt;</kbd> key while typing.
      </p>

      <p>
        To switch from one character set to the other press the
        <kbd>&lt;C=&gt;</kbd> and the <kbd>&lt;SHIFT&gt;</kbd> keys together.

      <h2><a name="Programming">PROGRAMMING NUMBERS AND VARIABLES</a></h2>

      <h3>
        <a name="Integer">INTEGER, FLOATING-POINT AND STRING CONSTANTS</a>
      </h3>

      <p>
        Constants are the data values that you put in your BASIC statements.
        BASIC uses these values to represent data during statement execution.
        CBM BASIC can recognize and manipulate three types of constants:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>INTEGER NUMBERS</li>
        <li>FLOATING-POINT NUMBERS</li>
        <li>STRINGS</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <b>Integer constants</b> are whole numbers (numbers without decimal
        points). Integer constants must be between -32768 and +32767.
        <i
          >Integer constants do not have decimal points or commas between
          digits.</i
        >
        If the plus (+) sign is left out, the constant is assumed to be a
        positive number. Zeros coming before a constant are ignored and
        shouldn't be used since they waste memory and slow down your program.
        However, they won't cause an error. Integers are stored in memory as
        two-byte binary numbers. Some examples of integer constants are:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code class="language-basic">
            -12
            8765
            -32768
            +44
            0
            -32767
        </code>
      </pre>

      <div class="alert">
        <b>Note:</b>
        <p>
          Do NOT put commas inside any number. For example, always type 32,000
          as 32000. If you put a comma in the middle of a number you will get
          the BASIC error message
          <b
            ><a href="../Appendices/page_400.html#syntax_error"
              >?SYNTAX ERROR</a
            ></b
          >.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        <b>Floating-point constants</b> are positive or negative numbers and can
        contain fractions. Fractional parts of a number may be shown using a
        decimal point. Once again remember that commas are NOT used between
        numbers. If the plus sign (+) is left off the front of a number, the
        Commodore 64 assumes that the number is positive. If you leave off the
        decimal point the computer will assume that it follows the last digit of
        the number. And as with integers, zeros that come before a constant are
        ignored. Floating-point constants can be used in two ways:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>SIMPLE NUMBER</li>
        <li>SCIENTIFIC NOTATION</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Floating-point constants will show you up to nine digits on your screen.
        These digits can represent values between -999999999. and +999999999. If
        you enter more than nine digits the number will be rounded based on the
        tenth digit. if the tenth digit is greater than or equal to 5 the number
        will be rounded upward. Less than 5 the number be rounded downward. This
        could be important to the final totals of some numbers you may want to
        work with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Floating-point numbers are stored (using five bytes of memory) and are
        manipulated in calculations with ten places of accuracy. However,
      </p>

      <p>
        the numbers are rounded to nine digits when results are printed. Some
        examples of simple floating-point numbers are:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code class="language-basic">
          1.23
          -.998877
          +3.1459
          .7777777
          -333.
          .01
        </code>
        </pre>

      <p>
        Numbers smaller than .01 or larger than 999999999. will be printed in
        scientific notation. In scientific notation a floating-point constant is
        made up of three parts:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>THE MANTISSA</li>
        <li>THE LETTER E</li>
        <li>THE EXPONENT</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The mantissa is a simple floating-point number. The letter E is used to
        tell you that you're seeing the number in exponential form. In other
        words E represents * 10 (eg., 3E3 = 3*10^3 = 3000). And the exponent is
        what multiplication power of 10 the number is raised to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both the mantissa and the exponent are signed (+ or -) numbers. The
        exponent's range is from -39 to +38 and it indicates the number of
        places that the actual decimal point in the mantissa would be moved to
        the left (-) or right (+) if the value of the constant were represented
        as a simple number.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a limit to the size of floating-point numbers that BASIC can
        handle, even in scientific notation: the largest number is
        +1.70141183E+38 and calculations which would result in a larger number
        will display the BASIC error message
        <b><a href="../Appendices/page_400.html#overflow">?OVERFLOW ERROR</a></b
        >. The smallest floating-point number is +2.93873588E-39 and
        calculations which result in a smaller value give you zero as an answer
        and NO error message. Some examples of floating-point numbers in
        scientific notation (and their decimal values) are:

        String constants are groups of alphanumeric information like letters,
        numbers and symbols. When you enter a string from the keyboard, it can
        have any length up to the space available in an 80-character line (that
        is, any character spaces NOT taken up by the line number and other
        required parts of the statement).
      </p>
      <p>
        A string constant can contain blanks, letters, numbers, punctuation and
        color or cursor control characters in any combination. You can even put
        commas between numbers.
        <i
          >The only character which cannot be included in a string is the double
          quote mark (").</i
        >
        This is because the double quote mark is used to define the beginning
        and end of the string. A string can also have a null value - which means
        that it can contain no character data. You can leave the ending quote
        mark off of a string if it's the last item on a line or if it's followed
        by a colon (:). Some examples of string constants are:

      <h3>
        <a name="Integer">INTEGER, FLOATING-POINT AND STRING VARIABLES</a>
      </h3>

      <p>
        Variables are names that represent data values used in your BASIC
        statements. The value represented by a variable can be assigned by
        setting it equal to a constant, or it can be the result of calculations
        in the program. Variable data, like constants, can be integers,
        floating-point numbers, or strings. If you refer to a variable name in a
        program before a value has been assigned, the BASIC Interpreter will
        automatically create the variable with a value of zero if it's an
        integer or floating-point number. Or it will create a variable with a
        null value if you're using strings.
      </p>

      <p>
        Variable names can be any length but only the first two characters are
        considered significant in CBM BASIC. This means that all names used for
        variables must NOT have the same first two characters.
        <i
          >Variable names may NOT be the same as BASIC keywords and they may NOT
          contain keywords in the middle of variable names.</i
        >
        Keywords include all BASIC commands, statements, function names and
        logical operator names. If you accidentally use a keyword in the middle
        of a variable name, the BASIC error message
        <b
          ><a href="../Appendices/page_400.html#syntax_error"
            >?SYNTAX ERROR</a
          ></b
        >
        will show up on your screen.
      </p>

      <p>
        The characters used to form variable names are the alphabet and the
        numbers 0-9. The first character of the name must be a letter. Data type
        declaration characters (%) and ($) can be used as the last character of
        the name. The percent sign declares the variable to be an integer and
        the dollar sign ($) declares a string variable. If no type declaration
        character is used the Interpreter will assume that the variable is a
        floating-point. Some examples of variable names, value assignments and
        data types are:

      <h3><a name="Integer">INTEGER, FLOATING-POINT AND STRING ARRAYS</a></h3>

      <p>
        An array is a table (or list) of associated data items referred to by a
        single variable name. In other words, an array is a sequence of related
        variables. A table of numbers can be seen as an array, for example.
      </p>
      The individual numbers within the table become "elements" of the array.
      <p>
        Arrays are a useful shorthand way of describing a large number of
        related variables. Take a table of numbers for instance. Let's say that
        the table has 10 rows of numbers with 20 numbers in each row. That makes
        total of 200 numbers in the table. Without a single array name to call
        on you would have to assign a unique name to each value in the table.
        But because you can use arrays you only need one name for the array and
        all the elements in the array are identified by their individual
        locations within the array.
      </p>
      <p>
        Array names can be integers, floating-points or string data types and
        all elements in the array have the same data type as the array name.
        Arrays can have a single dimension (as in a simple list) or they can
        have multiple dimensions (imagine a grid marked in rows and columns or a
        Rubik's Cube&reg;). Each element of an array is uniquely identified and
        referred to by a subscript (or index variable) following the array name,
        enclosed within parentheses ( ).
      </p>
      <p>
        The maximum number of dimensions an array can have in theory is 255 and
        the number of elements in each dimension is limited to 32767. But for
        practical purposes array sizes are limited by the memory space available
        to hold their data and/or the 80 character logical screen line. If an
        array has only one dimension and its subscript value will never exceed
        10 (11 items: 0 thru 10) then the array will be created by the
        Interpreter and filled with zeros (or nulls if string type) the first
        time any element of the array is referred to, otherwise the BASIC DIM
        statement must be used to define the shape and size of the array. The
        amount of memory required to store an array can be determined as
        follows:
      </p>

        Subscripts can be integer constants, variables, or an arithmetic
        expression which gives an integer result. Separate subscripts, with com-
        mas between them, are required for each dimension of an array.
        Subscripts can have values from zero up to the number of elements in the
        respective dimensions of the array. Values outside that range will cause
        the BASIC error message

      <h2><a name="Expressions">EXPRESSIONS AND OPERATORS</a></h2>

      <p>
        Expressions are formed using constants, variables and/or arrays. An
        expression can be a single constant, simple variable, or an array
        variable of any type. It can also be a combination of constants and
        variables with arithmetic, relational or logical operators designed to
        produce a single value. How operators work is explained below.
        Expressions can be separated into two classes:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>ARITHMETIC</li>
        <li>STRING</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Expressions are normally thought of as having two or more data items
        called operands. Each operand is separated by a single operator to
        produce the desired result. This is usually done by assigning the value
        of the expression to a variable name. All of the examples of constants
        and variables that you've seen so for, were also examples of
        expressions.
      </p>
      <p>
        An operator is a special symbol the BASIC Interpreter in your Commodore
        64 recognizes as representing an operation to be performed on the
        variables or constant data. One or more operators, combined with one or
        more variables and/or constants form an expression. Arithmetic,
        relational and logical operators are recognized by Commodore 64 BASIC.
      </p>

      <h3><a name="ArithmeticE">ARITHMETIC EXPRESSIONS</a></h3>

      <p>
        Arithmetic expressions, when solved, will give an integer or floating-
        point value. The arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, ^) are used to
        perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and
        exponentiation operations respectively.
      </p>

      <h3><a name="ArithmeticO">ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS</a></h3>

      <p>
        An arithmetic operator defines an arithmetic operation which is per-
        formed on the two operands on either side of the operator. Arithmetic
        operations are performed using floating-point numbers. Integers are
        converted to floating-point numbers before an arithmetic operation is
        performed. The result is converted back to an integer if it is assigned
        to an integer variable name.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>ADDITION (+)</b>: The plus sign (+) specifies that the operand on the
        right is added to the operand on the left.
      </p>

      <h5>EXAMPLES:</h5>
      <pre>
          <code class="language-basic">
            2+2
            A+B+C
            X%+1
            BR+10E-2
          </code>
        </pre>

      <p>
        <b>SUBTRACTION (-)</b>: The minus sign (-) specifies that the operand on
        the right is subtracted from the operand on the left.
      </p>

      <h5>EXAMPLES:</h5>
      <pre>
        <code class="language-basic">
          4-1
          100-64
          A-B
          55-142
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        The minus can also be used as a unary minus. That means that it is the
        minus sign in front of a negative number. This is equal to subtracting
        the number from zero (0).
      </p>

      <h5>EXAMPLES:</h5>
      <pre>
        <code class="language-basic">
          -5
          -9E4
          -B
          4-(-2) same as 4+2
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        <b>MULTIPLICATION (*)</b>: An asterisk (*) specifies that the operand on
        the left is multiplied by the operand on the right.
      </p>

      <h5>EXAMPLES:</h5>
      <pre>
        <code class="language-basic">
          100*2
          50*0
          A*X1
          R%*14
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        <b>DIVISION (/)</b>: The slash (/) specifies that the operand on the
        left is divided by the operand on the right.
      </p>

      <h5>EXAMPLES:</h5>
      <pre>
<code class="language-basic">
            10/2
            6400/4
            A/B
            4E2/XR
</code>
  </pre>
      <p>
        <b>EXPONENTIATION</b> The up arrow (^) specifies that the operand on the
        left is raised to the power specified by the operand on the right (the
        exponent). If the operand on the right is a 2, the number on the left is
        squared; if the exponent is a 3, the number on the left is cubed, etc.
        The exponent can be any number so long as the result of the operation
        gives a valid floating-point number.

      <h3><a name="Relational">RELATIONAL OPERATORS</a></h3>

      <p>
        The relational operators (&lt;, =, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, &lt;&gt;) are
        primarily used to compare the values of two operands, but they also
        produce an arithmetic result. The relational operators and the logical
        operators (<a href="../Chapter_2/page_035.html#and">AND</a>,
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_068.html#or">OR</a>, and
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_063.html#not">NOT</a>), when used in
        comparisons, actually produce an arithmetic true/false evaluation of an
        expression. If the relationship stated in the expression is true the
        result is assigned an integer value of - 1 and if it's false a value of
        0 is assigned. These are the relational operators:
      </p>

      <p>
        Relational operators can be used to compare strings. For comparison
        purposes, the letters of the alphabet have the order A&lt;B&lt;C&lt;D,
        etc. Strings are compared by evaluating the relationship between
        corresponding characters from left to right (see
        <a href="../Chapter_1/page_016.html#String">String Operations</a>).
      </p>

      <h5>EXAMPLES:</h5>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <td><code> "A" &lt; "B" </code></td>
          <td><code>result true (-1)</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code> "X" = "YY" </code></td>

      </table>

      <p>
        Numeric data items can only be compared (or assigned) to other numeric
        items. The same is true when comparing strings, otherwise the BASIC
        error message
        <b
          ><a href="../Appendices/page_400.html#type_mismatch"
            >?TYPE MISMATCH</a
          ></b
        >
        will occur. Numeric operands are compared by first converting the values
        of either or both operands from integer to floating-point form, as
        necessary. Then the relationship of the floating- point values is
        evaluated to give a true/false result.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the end of all comparisons, you get an integer no matter what data
        type the operand is (even if both are strings). Because of this, a
        comparison of two operands can be used as an operand in performing
        calculations. The result will be - 1 or 0 and can be used as anything
        but a divisor, since division by zero is illegal.
      </p>

      <h3><a name="Logical">LOGICAL OPERATORS</a></h3>

      <p>
        The logical operators (<a href="../Chapter_2/page_035.html#and">AND</a>,
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_068.html#or">OR</a>,
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_063.html#not">NOT</a>) can be used to modify
        the meanings of the relational operators or to produce an arithmetic
        result. Logical operators can produce results other than -1 and 0,
        though any nonzero result is considered true when testing for a
        true/false condition.
      </p>

      <p>
        The logical operators (sometimes called Boolean operators) can also be
        used to perform logic operations on individual binary digits (bits) in
        two operands. But when you're using the
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_063.html#not">NOT</a> operator, the operation
        is performed only on the single operand to the right. The operands must
        be in the integer range of values (-32768 to +32767) (floating-point
        numbers are converted to integers) and logical operations give an
        integer result.
      </p>

      <p>
        Logical operations are performed bit-by-corresponding-bit on the two
        operands. The logical
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_035.html#and">AND</a> produces a bit result
        of 1 only if both operand bits are 1. The logical
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_068.html#or">OR</a> produces a bit result of
        I if either operand bit is 1. The logical
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_063.html#not">NOT</a> is the opposite value
        of each bit as a single operand. In other words, it's really saying, "if
        it's <a href="../Chapter_2/page_063.html#not">NOT</a> 1 then it is 0. If
        it's <a href="../Chapter_2/page_063.html#not">NOT</a> 0 then it is 1."
      </p>

      <p>
        The exclusive OR (XOR) doesn't have a logical operator but it is
        performed as part of the
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_092.html#wait">WAIT</a> statement. Exclusive
        OR means that if the bits of two operands are equal then the result is 0
        otherwise the result is 1.
      </p>

      <p>
        Logical operations are defined by groups of statements which, taken
        together, constitute a Boolean "truth table" as shown in
        <a href="page_014.html#1-2">Table 1-2</a>.

      <h3><a name="Hierarchy">HIERARCHY OF OPERATIONS</a></h3>

      <p>
        All expressions perform the different types of operations according to a
        fixed hierarchy. In other words, certain operations are performed be-
        fore other operations. The normal order of operations can be modified by
        enclosing two or more operands within parentheses ( ), creating a
        "subexpression." The parts of an expression enclosed in parentheses will
        be reduced to a single value before working on parts outside the
        parentheses.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you use parentheses in expressions, they must be paired so that you
        always have an equal number of left and right parentheses. Otherwise,
        the BASIC error message
        <b
          ><a href="../Appendices/page_400.html#syntax_error"
            >?SYNTAX ERROR</a
          ></b
        >
        will appear.
      </p>

      <p>
        Expressions which have operands inside parentheses may themselves be
        enclosed in parentheses, forming complex expressions of multiple levels.
        This is called nesting. Parentheses can be nested in expressions to a
        maximum depth of ten levels-ten matching sets of parentheses. The
        inner-most expression has its operations performed first. Some examples
        of expressions are:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code class="language-basic">
          A+B
          C^(D+E)/2
          ((X-C^(D+E)/2)*10)+1
          GG$&gt;HH$
          JJ$+&quot;MORE&quot;
          K%=1 AND M&lt;&gt;X
          K%=2 OR (A=B AND M&lt;X)
          NOT (D=E)
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        The BASIC Interpreter will normally perform operations on expressions by
        performing arithmetic operations first, then relational operations, and
        logical operations lost. Both arithmetic and logical operators have an
        order of precedence (or hierarchy of operations) within themselves. On
        the other hand, relational operators do not have an order of precedence
        and will be performed as the expression is evaluated from left to right.
      </p>

      <p>
        If all remaining operators in an expression have the same level of
        precedence then operations happen from left to right. When performing
        operations on expressions within parentheses, the normal order of
        precedence is maintained. The hierarchy of arithmetic and logical
        operations is shown in Table 1-3 from first to last in order of
        precedence.

      <h3><a name="String">STRING OPERATIONS</a></h3>

      <p>
        Strings are compared using the same relational operators (=, &lt;&gt;,
        &lt;=, &gt;=, &lt;, &gt;) that are used for comparing numbers. String
        comparisons are mode by taking one character at a time (left-to-right)
        from each string and evaluating each character code position from the
        PET/ CBM character set. If the character codes are the same, the
        characters are equal. If the character codes differ, the character with
        the lower code number is lower in the character set. The comparison
        stops when the end of either string is reached. All other things being
        equal, the shorter string is considered less than the longer string.
        Leading or trailing blanks ARE significant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless of the data types, at the end of all comparisons you get an
        integer result. This is true even if both operands are strings. Because
        of this a comparison of two string operands can be used as an operand in
        performing calculations. The result will be - 1 or 0 (true or false) and
        can be used as anything but a divisor since division by zero is illegal.
      </p>

      <h3><a name="String">STRING EXPRESSIONS</a></h3>

      <p>
        Expressions are treated as if an implied "&lt;&gt;0" follows them. This
        means that if an expression is true then the next BASIC statements on.
        the same program line are executed. If the expression is false the rest
        of the line is ignored and the next line in the program is executed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just as with numbers, you can also perform operations on string
        variables. The only string arithmetic operator recognized by CBM BASIC
        is the plus sign (+) which is used to perform concatenation of strings.
        When strings are concatenated, the string on the right of the plus sign
        is appended to the string on the left, forming a third string as a
        result. The result can be printed immediately, used in a comparison, or
        assigned to a variable name. If a string data item is compared with (or
        set equal to) a numeric item, or vice-versa, the BASIC error message
        <b
          ><a href="../Appendices/page_400.html#type_mismatch"
            >?TYPE MISMATCH</a
          ></b
        >
        will occur. Some examples of string expressions and concatenation are:
      </p>

      <pre>

<code class="language-basic">
10 A$="FILE": B$="NAME"
20 NAM$=A$+B$           (gives the string: FILENAME)
30 RES$="NEW "+A$+B$    (gives the string: NEW FILENAME)

      <h2><a name="Programming">PROGRAMMING TECHNIQUES</a></h2>

      <h3><a name="Data">DATA CONVERSIONS</a></h3>

      <p>
        When necessary, the CBM BASIC Interpreter will convert a numeric data
        item from an integer to floating-point. or vice-versa, according to the
        following rules:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          All arithmetic and relational operations are performed in floating
          point format. Integers are converted to floating-point form for
          evaluation of the expression, and the result is converted back to
          integer. logical operations convert their operands to integers an
          return an integer result.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a numeric variable name of one type is set equal to a numeric data
          item of a different type, the number will be converted and stored as
          the data type declared in the variable name.
        </li>
        <li>
          When a floating-point value is converted to an integer, the fractional
          portion is truncated (eliminated) and the integer result is less than
          or equal to the floating-point value. If the result is outside the
          range of +32767 thru -32768, the BASIC error message
          <b
            ><a href="../Appendices/page_400.html#illegal_quantity"
              >?ILLEGAL QUANTITY</a

          will occur.

      </ul>

      <h3><a name="Using">USING THE INPUT STATEMENT</a></h3>

      <p>
        Now that you know what variables are, let's take that information an put
        it together with the
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_054.html#input">INPUT</a> statement for some
        practical programming applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our first example, you can think of a variable as a "storage
        compartment" where the Commodore 64 stores the user's response to your
        prompt question. To write a program which asks the user to type in a
        name, you might assign the variable N$ to the name typed in. Now every
        time you PRINT N$ in your program, the Commodore 64 will automatically
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_070.html#print">PRINT</a> the name that the
        user typed in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Type the word <a href="../Chapter_2/page_062.html#new">NEW</a> on your
        Commodore 64. Hit the <kbd>&lt;RETURN&gt;</kbd> key and try this
        example:
      </p>

      <pre>
<code class="language-basic">
     10 PRINT"YOUR NAME": INPUT N$
     20 PRINT"HELLO",N$
</code>
</pre>

      <p>
        In this example you used N to remind yourself that this variable stands
        for "NAME". The dollar sign ($) is used to tell the computer that you're
        using a string variable. It is important to differentiate between the
        two types of variables:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>NUMERIC</li>
        <li>STRING</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        You probably remember from the earlier sections that numeric variables
        are used to store number values such as 1, 100, 4000, etc. A numeric
        variable can be a single letter (A), any two letters (AB), a letter and
        a number (AI), or two letters and a number (AB1). You can save memory
        space by using shorter variables. Another helpful hint is to use letters
        and numbers for different categories in the same program (AI, A2, A3).
        Also, if you want whole numbers for an answer instead of numbers with
        decimal points, all you have to do is put a percent sign (%) at the end
        of your variable name (AB%, AI%, etc.) Now let's look at a few examples
        that use different types of variables and expressions with the
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_054.html#input">INPUT</a> statement.
      </p>

      <pre>
<code class="language-basic">
      10 PRINT"ENTER A NUMBER": INPUT A
      20 PRINT A
   
      10 PRINT"ENTER A WORD": INPUT A$
      20 PRINT A$
   
      10 PRINT"ENTER A NUMBER": INPUT A
      20 PRINT A "TIMES 5 EQUALS" A*5
</code>
 </pre>
      <div class="alert">
        <b>NOTE</b>: Example 3 shows that MESSAGES or PROMPTS are inside the
        quotation marks (" ") while the variables are outside. Notice, too, that
        in line 20 the variable A was printed first, then the message "TIMES 5
        EQUALS", and then the calculation, multiply variable A by 5 (A*5).
      </div>

      <p>
        Calculations are important in most programs. You have a choice of using
        "actual numbers" or variables when doing calculations, but if you're
        working with numbers supplied by a user you must use numeric variables.
        Begin by asking the user to type in two numbers like this:
      </p>

      <pre>
    <code class="language-basic">10 PRINT"TYPE 2 NUMBERS": INPUT A: INPUT B</code>

      <p>
        Now multiply those two numbers together to create a new variable C as
        shown in line 20 below:
      </p>

      <pre>
     <code class="language-basic">20 C=A*B</code>
  </pre>
      <p>
        To <a href="../Chapter_2/page_070.html#print">PRINT</a> the result as a
        message type
      </p>
      <pre>
    <code class="language-basic">30 PRINT A "TIMES" B "EQUALS" C</code>
  </pre>
      <p>
        Enter these 3 lines and
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_081.html#run">RUN</a> the program. Notice
        that the messages are inside the quotes while the variables are not.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now let's say that you wanted a dollar sign ($) in front of the number
        represented by variable C. The $ must be
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_070.html#print">PRINTed</a> inside quotes and
        in front of variable C. To add the $ to your program hit the
        <kbd>&lt;RUN/STOP&gt;</kbd> and <kbd>&lt;RESTORE&gt;</kbd> keys. Now
        type in line 40 as follows:
      </p>

      <pre>
    <code class="language-basic">40 PRINT"$" C</code>
   </pre>

      <p>
        Now hit <kbd>&lt;RETURN&gt;</kbd>, type
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_081.html#run">RUN</a> and hit
        <kbd>&lt;RETURN&gt;</kbd> again. The dollar sign goes in quotes because
        the variable C only represents a number and can't contain a $. If the
        number represented by C was 100 then the Commodore 64 screen would
        display $ 100. But, if you tried to PRINT $C without using the quotes,
        you would get a
        <b
          ><a href="../Appendices/page_400.html#syntax_error"
            >?SYNTAX ERROR</a
          ></b
        >
        message.
      </p>

      <p>
        One last tip about $$$: You can create a variable that represents a
        dollar sign which you can then substitute for the $ when you want to use
        it with numeric variables. For example:
      </p>

      <pre>
    <code class="language-basic">10 Z$="$"</code>
   </pre>

      <p>
        Now whenever you need a dollar sign you can use the string variable Z$.
        Try this:
      </p>

      <pre>
    <code class="language-basic">
      10 Z$="$": INPUT A
      20 PRINT Z$A<
    </code>
   </pre>

      <p>
        Line 10 defines the $ as a string variable called Z$, and then
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_054.html#input">INPUTs</a> a number called A.
        Line 20 <a href="../Chapter_2/page_070.html#print">PRINTs</a> Z$ ($)
        next to A (number).
      </p>

      <p>
        You'll probably find that it's easier to assign certain characters, like
        dollar signs, to a string variable than to type "$" every time you want
        to calculate dollars or other items which require " " like %.
      </p>

      <h3><a name="Using">USING THE GET STATEMENT</a></h3>

      <p>
        Most simple programs use the
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_054.html#input">INPUT</a> statement to get
        data from the person operating the computer. When you're dealing with
        more complex needs, like protection from typing errors, the
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_049.html#get">GET</a> statement gives you
        more flexibility and your program more "intelligence." This section
        shows you how to use the
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_049.html#get">GET</a> statement to add some
        special screen editing features to your programs.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Commodore 64 has a keyboard buffer that holds up to 10 characters.
        This means that if the computer is busy doing some operation and it's
        not reading the keyboard, you can still type in up to 10 characters,
        which will be used as soon as the Commodore 64 finishes what it was
        doing. To demonstrate this, type in this program on your Commodore 64:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code class="language-basic">
          NEW
          10 TI$="000000"
          20 IF TI$ &lt; "000015" THEN 20
        </code>
     </pre>
      <p>
        Now type <a href="../Chapter_2/page_081.html#run">RUN</a>, hit
        <kbd>d&lt;RETURN&gt;</kbd> and while the program is RUNning type in the
        word HELLO.
      </p>

      <p>
        Notice that nothing happened for about 15 seconds when the program
        started. Only then did the message HELLO appear on the screen.
      </p>

      <p>
        Imagine standing in line for a movie. The first person in the line is
        the first to get a ticket and leave the line. The last person in line is
        last for a ticket. The
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_049.html#get">GET</a> statement acts like a
        ticket taker. First it looks to see if there are any characters "in
        line." In other words have any keys been typed. If the answer is yes
        then that character gets placed in the appropriate variable. If no key
        was pressed then an empty value is assigned to a variable,
      </p>

      <p>
        At this point it's important to note that if you try to put more than 10
        characters into the buffer at one time, all those over the 10th
        character will be lost.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since the <a href="../Chapter_2/page_049.html#get">GET</a> statement
        will keep going even when no character is typed, it is often necessary
        to put the <a href="../Chapter_2/page_049.html#get">GET</a> statement
        into a loop so that it will have to wait until someone hits a key or
        until a character is received through your program. Below is the
        recommended form for the
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_049.html#get">GET</a> statement. Type
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_062.html#new">NEW</a> to erase your previous
        program.
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code class="language-basic">10 GET A$: IF A$ ="" THEN 10</code>
     </pre>

      <p>
        Notice that there is NO SPACE between the quote marks("") on this line.
        This indicates an empty value and sends the program back to the
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_049.html#get">GET</a> statement in a
        continuous loop until someone hits a key on the computer. Once a key is
        hit the program will continue with the line following line 10. Add this
        line to your program:
      </p>

      <pre>
      <code class="language-basic">100 PRINT A$;: GOTO 10</code>
     </pre>

      <p>
        Now <a href="../Chapter_2/page_081.html#run">RUN</a> the program. Notice
        that no cursor appears on the screen, but any character you type will be
        printed in the screen. This 2-line program can be turned into part of a
        screen editor program as shown below.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are many things you can do with a screen editor. You can have a
        flashing cursor. You can keep certain keys like
        <kbd>&lt;CLR/HOME&gt;</kbd> from accidentally erasing the whole screen.
        You might even want to be able to use your function keys to represent
        whole words or phrases. And speaking of function keys, the following
        program lines give each function key a special purpose. Remember this is
        only the beginning of a program that you can customize for your needs.
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code class="language-basic">
          20 IF A$ = CHR$(133) THEN POKE 53280,8: GOTO 10
          30 IF A$ = CHR$(134) THEN POKE 53281,4: GOTO 10
          40 IF A$ = CHR$(135) THEN A$="DEAR SIR:"+CHR$(13)
          50 IF A$ = CHR$(136) THEN A$="SINCERELY,"+CHR$(13)
        </code>
     </pre>

      <p>
        The <a href="../Chapter_2/page_038.html#chr$">CHR$</a> numbers in
        parentheses come from the
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_038.html#chr$">CHR$</a> code chart in
        Appendix C. The chart lists a different number for each character. The
        four function keys are set up to perform the tasks represented by the
        instructions that follow the word
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_052.html#if">THEN</a> in each line. By
        changing the <a href="../Chapter_2/page_038.html#chr$">CHR$</a> number
        inside each set of parentheses you can designate different keys.
        Different instructions would be performed if you changed the information
        after the <a href="../Chapter_2/page_052.html#if">THEN</a> statement.
      </p>

      <h3><a name="How">HOW TO CRUNCH BASIC PROGRAMS</a></h3>

      <p>
        You can pack more instructions - and power - into your BASIC programs by
        making each program as short as possible. This process of shortening
        programs is called "crunching."
      </p>

      <p>
        Crunching programs lets you squeeze the maximum possible number of
        instructions into your program. It also helps you reduce the size of
        programs which might not otherwise run in a given size; and if you're
        writing a program which requires the input of data such as inventory
        items, numbers or text, a short program will leave more memory space
        free to hold data.
      </p>

      <h3>ABBREVIATING KEYWORDS</h3>

      <p>
        A list of keyword abbreviations is given in Appendix A. This is helpful
        when you program because you can actually crowd more information on each
        line using abbreviations. The most frequently used abbreviation is the
        question mark (?) which is the BASIC abbreviation for the
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_070.html#print">PRINT</a> command. However,
        if you <a href="../Chapter_2/page_058.html#list">LIST</a> a program that
        has abbreviations, the Commodore 64 will automatically print out the
        listing with the full-length keywords. If any program line exceeds 80
        characters (2 lines on the screen) with the keywords unabbreviated, and
        you want to change it, you will have to re-enter that line with the
        abbreviations before saving the program.
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_081.html#save">SAVEing</a> a program
        incorporates the keywords without inflating any lines because BASIC
        keywords are tokenized by the Commodore 64. Usually, abbreviations are
        added after a program is written and it isn't going to be
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_058.html#list">LISTed</a> any more before
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_081.html#save">SAVEing</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>SHORTENING PROGRAM LINE NUMBERS</h3>

      <p>
        Most programmers start their programs at line 100 and number each fine
        at intervals of 10 (i.e., 100, 110, 120). This allows extra lines of
        instruction to be added (111, 112, etc.) as the program is developed.
        One means of crunching the program after it is completed is to change
        the fine numbers to the lowest numbers possible (i.e., 1, 2, 3) because
        longer line numbers take more memory than shorter numbers when
        referenced by <a href="../Chapter_2/page_052.html#goto">GOTO</a> and
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_051.html#gosub">GOSUB</a> statements. For
        instance, the number 100 uses 3 bytes of memory (one for each number)
        while the number I uses only 1 byte.
      </p>

      <h3>PUTTING MULTIPLE INSTRUCTIONS ON EACH LINE</h3>

      <p>
        You can put more than one instruction on each numbered line in your
        program by separating them by a colon. The only limitation is that all
        the instructions on each line, including colons, should not exceed the
        standard 80-character line length. Here is an example of two programs,
        before and after crunching:
      </p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>
            BEFORE CRUNCHING:
          </th>
          <th>AFTER CRUNCHING:</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre>
      10 PRINT"HELLO...";            
      20 FOR T=1 TO 500: NEXT           
      30 PRINT"HELLO, AGAIN..."
      40 GOTO 10
     </pre
            >
          </td>
          <td>
            <pre>
     10 PRINT "HELLO...";:FORT=1TO500:NEXT:
     PRINT"HELLO, AGAIN...":GOTO10
     </pre
            >
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>REMOVING REM STATEMENTS</h3>

      <p>
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_077.html#rem">REM</a> statements are helpful
        in reminding yourself-or showing other programmers - what a particular
        section of a program is doing. However, when the program is completed
        and ready to use, you probably won't need those
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_077.html#rem">REM</a> statements anymore and
        you can save quite a bit of space by removing the
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_077.html#rem">REM</a> statements. If you plan
        to revise or study the program structure in the future, it's a good idea
        to keep a copy on file with the
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_077.html#rem">REM</a> statements intact.
      </p>

      <h3>USING VARIABLES</h3>

      <p>
        If a number, word or sentence is used repeatedly in your program it's
        usually best to define those long words or numbers with a one or two
        letter variable. Numbers can be defined as single letters. Words and
        sentences can be defined as string variables using a letter and dollar
        sign. Here's one example:
      </p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>
            BEFORE CRUNCHING:
          </th>
          <th>AFTER CRUNCHING:</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre>
 10 POKE 54296,15                  
 20 POKE 54276,33                  
 30 POKE 54273,10                  
 40 POKE 54273,40                  
 50 POKE 54273,70
 60 POKE 54296,0
</pre
            >
          </td>
          <td>
            <pre>
10 V=54296:F=54273
20 POKEV,15:POKE54276,33
30 POKEF,10:POKEF,40:POKEF,70
40 POKEV,0
</pre
            >
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>USING READ AND DATA STATEMENTS</h3>

      <p>
        Large amounts of data can be typed in as one piece of data at a time,
        over and over again ... or you can print the instructional part of the
        program ONCE and print all the data to be handled in a long running list
        called the <a href="../Chapter_2/page_042.html#data">DATA</a> statement.
        This is especially good for crowding large lists of numbers into a
        program.
      </p>

      <h3>USING ARRAYS AND MATRICES</h3>

      <p>
        Arrays and matrices are similar to
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_042.html#data">DATA</a> statements in that
        long amounts of data can be handled as a list, with the data handling
        portion of the program drawing from that list, in sequence. Arrays
        differ in that the list can be multi-dimensional
      </p>

      <h3>ELIMINATING SPACES</h3>

      <p>
        One of the easiest ways to reduce the size of your program is to
        eliminate all the spaces. Although we often include spaces in sample
        programs to provide clarity, you actually don't need any spaces in your
        program and will save space if you eliminate them.
      </p>

      <h4>USING GOSUB ROUTINES</h4>

      <p>
        If you use a particular line or instruction over and over, it might be
        wise to <a href="../Chapter_2/page_051.html#gosub">GOSUB</a> to the line
        from several places in your program, rather than write the whole line or
        instruction every time you use it.
      </p>

      <h4>USING TAB AND SPC</h4>

      <p>
        Instead of
        <a href="../Chapter_2/page_070.html#print">PRINTing</a> several cursor
        commands to position a character on the screen, it is often more
