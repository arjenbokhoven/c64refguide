      <h2><a name="Introduction">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

      <p>
        The <b>COMMODORE 64 PROGRAMMER'S REFERENCE GUIDE</b> has been developed
        as a working tool and reference source for those of you who want to
        maximize your use of the built-in capabilities of your
        <b>COMMODORE 64</b>. This manual contains the information you need for
        your programs, from the simplest example all the way to the most
        complex. The <b>PROGRAMMER'S REFERENCE GUIDE</b> is designed so that
        everyone from the beginning BASIC programmer to the professional
        experienced in 6502 machine language can get information to develop his
        or her own creative programs. At the same time this book shows you how
        clever your <b>COMMODORE 64</b> really is.
      </p>

      <p>
        This <b>REFERENCE GUIDE</b> is not designed to teach the BASIC
        programming language or the 6502 machine language. There is, however, an
        extensive glossary of terms and a "semi-tutorial" approach to many of
        the sections in the book. If you don't already have a working knowledge
        of BASIC and how to use it to program, we suggest that you study the
        <b>COMMODORE 64 USER'S GUIDE</b> that came with your computer. The
        <b>USER'S GUIDE</b> gives you an easy to read introduction to the BASIC
        programming language. If you still have difficulty understanding how to
        use BASIC then turn to the back of this book (or Appendix N in the
        <b>USER'S GUIDE</b>) and check out the
        <a href="Appendices/page_388.html#Bibliography">Bibliography</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <b>COMMODORE 64 PROGRAMMER'S REFERENCE GUIDE</b> is just that; a
        reference. Like most reference books, your ability to apply the
        information creatively really depends on how much knowledge you have
        about the subject. In other words if you are a novice programmer you
        will not be able to use all the facts and figures in this book until you
        expand your current programming knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        What you can do with this book is to find a considerable amount of
        valuable programming reference information written in easy to read,
        plain English with the programmer's jargon explained. On the other hand
        the programming professional will find all the information needed to use
        the capabilities of the <b>COMMODORE 64</b> effectively.
      </p>

      <h3><a name="What"></a>WHAT'S INCLUDED?</a></h3>
        
      <ul>
      <li>  Our complete "BASIC dictionary" includes Commodore BASIC language
            commands, statements and functions listed in alphabetical order.
            We've created a "quick list" which contains all the words and their
            abbreviations. This is followed by a section containing a more
            detailed definition of each word along with sample BASIC programs
            to illustrate how they work.</li>
      <li>  If you need an introduction to using machine language with BASIC
            programs our layman's overview will get you started.</li>
      <li>  A powerful feature of all Commodore computers is called the KERNAL.
            It helps insure that the programs you write today can also be used
            on your Commodore computer of tomorrow.</li>
      <li>  The Input/Output Programming section gives you the opportunity to
            use your computer to the limit. It describes how to hook-up and use
            everything from lightpens and joysticks to disk drives, printers,
            and telecommunication devices called modems.</li>
      <li>  You can explore the world of SPRITES, programmable characters, and
            high resolution graphics for the most detailed and advanced animated
            pictures in the microcomputer industry.</li>
      <li>  You can also enter the world of music synthesis and create your own
            songs and sound effects with the best built-in synthesizer available
            in any personal computer.</li>
      <li>  If you're an experienced programmer, the soft load language section
            gives you information about the <b>COMMODORE 64's</b> ability to run CP/M*
            and high level languages. This is in addition to BASIC.</li>
      </ul>

      
      <p>Think of your <b>COMMODORE 64 PROGRAMMER'S REFERENCE GUIDE</b> as a
      useful tool to help you and you will enjoy the -hours of programming ahead
      of you.

      <h3><a name="How">HOW TO USE THIS REFERENCE GUIDE</a></h3>

      <p>
        Throughout this manual certain conventional notations are used to
        describe the syntax (programming sentence structure) of BASIC commands
        or statements and to show both the required and optional parts of each
        BASIC keyword. The rules to use for interpreting statement syntax are as
        follows:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          BASIC keywords are shown in capital letters. They must appear where
          shown in the statement, entered and spelled exactly as shown.
        </li>

        <li>
          Items shown within quotation marks (" ") indicate variable data which
          you must put in. Both the quotation marks and the data inside the
          quotes must appear where shown in each statement.
        </li>

        <li>
          Items inside the square brackets ([ ]) indicate an optional statement
          parameter. A parameter is a limitation or additional qualifier for
          your statements. If you use an optional parameter you must supply the
          data for that optional parameter. In addition, ellipses (...) show
          that an optional item can be repeated as many times as a programming
          line allows.
        </li>

        <li>
          If an item in the square brackets ([ ]) is UNDERLINED, that means that
          you MUST use those certain characters in the optional parameters, and
          they also have to be spelled exactly as shown. 5. Items inside angle
          brackets (&lt; &gt;) indicate variable data which you provide. While
          the slash (/) indicates that you must make a choice between two
          mutually exclusive options.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>EXAMPLE OF SYNTAX FORMAT:</h3>

      <code>
        OPEN&lt;file-num&gt;,&lt;device&gt;[,&lt;address&gt;],["&lt;drive&gt;:&lt;filename&gt;][,&lt;mode&gt;]"
      </code>

      <h3>EXAMPLES OF ACTUAL STATEMENTS:</h3>

      <pre>
          10 OPEN 2,8,6,"0:STOCK FOLIO,S,W"
          20 OPEN 1,1,2,"CHECKBOOK"
          30 OPEN 3,4
      </pre>

      <p>
        When you actually apply the syntax conventions in a practical situation,
        the sequence of parameters in your statements might not be exactly the
        same as the sequence shown in syntax examples. The examples are not
        meant to show every possible sequence. They are intended to present all
        required and optional parameters.
      </p>

      <p>
        Programming examples in this book are shown with blanks separating words
        and operators for the sake of readability. Normally though, BASIC
        doesn't require blanks between words unless leaving them out would give
        you an ambiguous or incorrect syntax.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shown below are some examples and descriptions of the symbols used for
        various statement parameters in the following chapters. The list is not
        meant to show every possibility, but to give you a better understanding
        as to how syntax examples are presented.

      <p>
        When you first thought about buying a computer you probably asked
        yourself, "Now that I can afford to buy a computer, what can I do with
        it once I get one?" The great thing about your <b>COMMODORE 64</b> is
        that you can make it do what YOU want it to do!
      </p>

      <p>
        You can make it calculate and keep track of home and business budget
        needs. You can use it for word processing. You can make it play
        arcade-style action games. You can make it sing. You can even create
        your own animated cartoons, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best part of owning a <b>COMMODORE 64</b> is that even if it did
        only one of the things listed below it would be well worth the price you
        paid for it. But the 64 is a complete computer and it does do EVERYTHING
        listed and then some!
      </p>

      <p>

        Commodore wants you to know that our support for users only STARTS with
        your purchase of a Commodore computer. That's why we've created two
        publications with Commodore information from around the world, and a
        "two-way" computer information network with valuable input for users in
        the U.S. and Canada from coast to coast.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, we wholeheartedly encourage and support the growth of
        Commodore Users' Clubs around the world. They are an excellent source of
        information for every Commodore computer owner from the beginner to the
        most advanced. The magazines and network, which are more fully described
        below, have the most up-to-date information about how to get involved
        with the Users' Club in your area.

        Finally, your local Commodore dealer is a useful source of Commodore
